# AISOBMFFWVDFBUTFAII

**A**n **ISOBMFF** **W**eb **V**isualizer **D**one **F**or **B**etter **U**nderstanding **T**he **F**ormat **A**nd **I**ts **I**ntricacies is a pretty simple web-based ISOBMFF visualizer.

It parses ISOBMFF-based (such as .mp4) files thanks to the [FileReader APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader). As such, it works on any "static" webpage (such as github-pages) without needing any file to be sent to a web server.

This repo was created mainly because I wanted to have a good overview of MP4/fragmented MP4 files metadata, mainly DASH and Smooth Streaming segments/fragments. None of the already existing tools met my expectations.

## What's with the name?

Including "ISOBMFF" in a project's name is not easy.
